# CSE 343 Machine Learning Project

## Rainfall Prediction using Machine Learning (T-28)

#### Work done as a part of the course CSE 343: Machine Learning by Prof. Jainendra Shukla.

## About the Project

#### There are a plethora of rainfall issues around the globe, floods are an important issue leading to the devastation of life and property. Saving human life and property becomes a challenging task at the time of floods and heavy rainfall. Unsuccessful rainfall predictions can lead to huge losses, hence, it becomes a challenging problem to solve. Lack of rainfall can also lead to forest fire due to dry climates which in turn leads to huge loss of life and property.

#### In this project, we work on the Australia Rain dataset from kaggle and predict whether there will be rainfall tomorrow based on todayâ€™s weather parameters. A case study of different ML models is presented along with reasoning, explaining the differences in the working of these models.

## DataSet
#### [DataSet](https://github.com/RahulSethi070801/ML_Project/blob/main/DataSet/weatherAUS.csv)
#### You can download the Kaggle Dataset from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/jsphyg/weather-dataset-rattle-package/version/2)
#### The dataset used is the Australian Rain dataset on kaggle. It contains data for the last 10 years across different regions of Australia. There are 24 columns in the dataset, as shown by Table below

## EDA and Pre-Processing
#### All the plots for EDA and Pre-processing are added in the folder [EDA+Preprocessing](https://github.com/RahulSethi070801/ML_Project/tree/main/EDA%2BPreprocessing)

## Methodology 
#### We performed various ML methods and did analysis for both Oversampled and Undersampled dataset done through sklearn library.

#### Code for both parts : - 
#### [Oversampled](https://github.com/RahulSethi070801/ML_Project/blob/main/ml_project_oversampled.ipynb)
#### [Undersampled](https://github.com/RahulSethi070801/ML_Project/blob/main/ml_project_undersampled.ipynb)

## Results and Analysis
#### Refer to [Report_28](https://github.com/RahulSethi070801/ML_Project/blob/main/Report_T28.pdf) for results and analysis(tables included)
#### All the plots for results are added in the folder [Results](https://github.com/RahulSethi070801/ML_Project/tree/main/Results)
